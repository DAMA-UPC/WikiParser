REQUIREMENTS
===
WikiParser parses English Wikipedia dump files into CSV files. It requires the following 
files:
- enwiki-XXX-pages-articles.xml
- enwiki-XXX-categorylinks.xml
- enwiki-XXX-page.sql
 
Files can be downloaded from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/

XXX gives information about the date of the dump. 


CONFIGURE
===

WikiParser can be canfigured to parse the following data:

- articleIds.csv: articleId, articleTitle  //Relates each article pageId with its title.
- articlesText.csv: articleId, articleText //Relates each article with its plain text.
- categoriesIds.csv: wikipedia_categoryId, categoryName //Relates each category pageId with its name.
- links.csv: articleId_From, articleId_To //Relates two linked articles.
- redirects.csv: articleId_From, articleId_To //Relates redirect articles.
- articleToCategories.csv: articleId_From, categoryId_To //Relates linked articles and categories.
- categoryToCategories.csv: categoryId_From, categoryId_To //Relates two linked categories.

In order to configure it, modify the exampleConfig.cfg file to indicate what information to retrieve
and where to store it.

- In **PAGE_ARTICLES_FILE** specify where the XXX--pages-articles.xml is.
- In **CSV_FOLDER specify** where to store the results.
- Use **GET_ARTICLES_TEXT**, **GET_ARTICLES_LINKS**, **GET_ARTICLES_REDIRECTS** and **GET_CATEGORIES_RELATIONS** to indicate what information to parse.

In order to run WikiParser, you need to install mysql into your system. 
MySQL is used to store XXX-categorylinks.sql and XXX-pages.sql, which
are required to extract the links to/of the categories.

DATABASE info (user,pw and DB name) has to be in the exampleConfig.cfg
